# redtype kanban

Simple time and task tracker

It will integrate with [Coda](https://coda.io/) soon

## Developing

I choose to use [bun](https://bun.sh/), which is a drop-in replacement for node
and npm. You can just replace all of its invocations with `npm` or `npx`. Don't
check in your `package-lock.json`, please.
